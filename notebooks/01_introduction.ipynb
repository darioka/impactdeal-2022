    "\n",
    "All scripts and notebook are meant to be run on Colab, with the default versions of the python packages provided in the Colab environment (June 2022) and a small number of other libraries. The files [environment.yml](https://github.com/darioka/impactdeal-2022/blob/main/environment.yml) or [requirements.txt](https://github.com/darioka/impactdeal-2022/blob/main/requirements.txt) can be used to install the correct versions.\n",

    "In a Colab notebook, simply use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "!pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead you want to run the notebooks on your own machine, my suggestion is to use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and create new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -n impactdeal --file environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some parts of the notebooks assume the working directory to be `impactdeal-2022/notebooks`."
